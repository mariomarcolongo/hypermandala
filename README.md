# Hypermandala

**A geometric mandala that unfolds from 2D squares into 3D temple blocks and then into a true 4D projection.**

Hypermandala is a dependency-free Canvas visualization. Its interaction model is inspired by [Tarek Sherif's Tesseract Explorer](https://github.com/tsherif/tesseract-explorer): the 4D object is manipulated in 4D space, projected into 3D, and then viewed with an ordinary 3D camera.

No source code from Tesseract Explorer is required by Hypermandala; the implementation here is independent.

## Dimensional model

The same primitive architecture is used across all dimensions:

- **2D** — a mandala plan built from square cells and triangular roof lines.
- **3D** — the square cells extrude into cubes and the roof lines become square pyramids, forming a stepped temple.
- **4D** — every cube is extruded along W into a tesseract-like module, and every pyramid becomes a 4D prism.

The transition is automatic. There is no fractional-dimension slider:

```
square → cube → hypercube
2D       3D      4D
```

Going directly from 2D to 4D automatically passes through 3D, and vice versa.

## 4D exploration

Hypermandala supports rotations in all six coordinate planes:

- **XY**
- **XZ**
- **YZ**
- **XW**
- **YW**
- **ZW**

The XW/YW/ZW rotations are the ones that most directly reveal the fourth coordinate.

Each rotation plane also has an **A** button for autorotation.

The small **projected basis** gizmo shows how the X, Y, Z, and W basis directions appear after the current 4D rotation and projection.

## Projection

Two 4D → 3D projection modes are available:

- **Perspective** — a virtual 4D camera sits along W; geometry farther away in W projects smaller.
- **Orthographic** — W is flattened without perspective scaling.

After the 4D → 3D projection, mouse drag orbits an ordinary 3D camera and the wheel zooms.

## Axis scale

X, Y, Z, and W can be scaled independently. This is especially useful for understanding the dimensional construction:

- reducing **Z** collapses the temple toward its 2D square plan;
- reducing **W** collapses each tesseract-like module toward its 3D cube.

The 2D / 3D / 4D buttons perform these dimensional changes automatically.

## Mandala families

Hypermandala now has multiple geometry generators. Every family uses the same dimensional engine and the same six-plane 4D rotations.

### Square Temple

The original architectural family:

- square cells in 2D;
- cubes and square pyramids in 3D;
- tesseract-like cube extrusions and 4D pyramid prisms in 4D.

Its plan uses a symmetric diamond arrangement with four cardinal extensions and a stepped central shrine.

### Triangle Yantra

A more classical yantra-inspired family built from alternating upward/downward equilateral triangles:

- nested triangular plans;
- triangular prisms and triangular pyramids in 3D;
- those prisms extruded through W in 4D.

The complex version adds denser nested triangles, an outer ring of triangular modules, and six elevated satellite peaks.

### Hexagonal Mandala

A sixfold family built from concentric and satellite hexagons:

- hexagonal rings in 2D;
- stepped hexagonal prisms and pyramids in 3D;
- W-extruded hexagonal 4D prisms.

The complex version adds a twelve-module outer ring and six elevated satellite shrines.

### Complexity

Each family has **Simple** and **Complex** variants. Complexity changes the generated geometry itself rather than merely adding decoration, so the extra structure participates in 3D and 4D transformations.

The primitive vocabulary deliberately remains limited—polygons, prisms, pyramids, cubes and their W-extrusions—so even the complex mandalas remain readable under 4D rotation.

## Color

- **Form** — mostly neutral geometry, with W edges highlighted.
- **Axis** — X red, Y green, Z blue, W gold.

## Controls

- **Mandala** — switch between Square Temple, Triangle Yantra, and Hexagonal Mandala.
- **Complexity** — choose Simple or Complex generated geometry.
- **2D / 3D / 4D** — automatic dimensional transitions.
- **Drag** — rotate the 2D plan or orbit the 3D projection.
- **Wheel / trackpad** — zoom.
- **Rotation planes** — rotate the object in 4D.
- **A** — autorotate an individual plane.
- **Axis scale** — scale X/Y/Z/W.
- **Projection** — perspective or orthographic.
- **Color** — form or axis.
- **Reset** — restore rotations, scale, camera, projection, and color.

Keyboard: `2`, `3`, `4` switch dimensions; `R` resets.
